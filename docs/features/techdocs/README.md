## What is it?

<!-- Intro, backstory, etc.: -->

TechDocs is Spotifyâ€™s homegrown docs-like-code solution built directly into Backstage. Engineers write their documentation in Markdown files which live together with their code - and with little configuration get a nice-looking doc site in Backstage.

Today, it is one of the core products in Spotifyâ€™s developer experience offering with 5000+ documentation sites and around 10000 average daily hits. Read more about TechDocs in its
[announcement blog post](https://backstage.io/blog/2020/09/08/announcing-tech-docs).
