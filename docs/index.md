# Backstage Developer Portal

## What is the Dev Portal?

The developer portal, or dev portal, is a centralized platform that unifies all the infrastructure tooling, SDKs, services, APIs, applications, and other documentation within Grainger.

## Backstage Software Catalog

The Software Catalog enable teams to manage the various software components they own. This also allows developers to find the service owners or owning teams of other software components at Grainger. Documentation is linked to each entry in the service catalog, which makes it easy to learn about the component.

## Backstage Software Templates

Software templates make it easy for developers to create new microservices, applications, CircleCI pipelines, and other software components from starter kits with Grainger best practices baked-in. Software templates drastically reduce the lead time for setting up a new "Hello World" project, so more time can be spent on developing new features.

## Backstage TechDocs

TechDocs is a docs-like-code solution that is built-in to Backstage. Documentation is written in markdown files and lives in the same project directory. Documentation can be viewed from the componenet page or within the docs tab in Backstage.
