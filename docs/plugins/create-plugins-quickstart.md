Backstage is a plugin-driven application, which allows developers to easily expose infrastructure and tools on the dev portal. This guide will take you through the steps of creating your own plugin.

If you have an idea for a plugin you would like to create, please begin by reaching out the ***Core Engineering Capabilities*** team via a request on the ***#core_eng_support*** Slack channel. Include high-level information on your idea for the plugin in your request. The appropriate members of the Core Engineering Capabilities team will schedule a meeting with you to discuss further details.
